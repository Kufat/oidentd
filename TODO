There is no ipfw support for FreeBSD, and as far as I can tell, the kernel
doesn't keep information necessary to implement it, so if you want IP
masquerade support on FreeBSD use ipf instead of ipfw.  I'd love to be
proven wrong, though.

Add IPv6 support and IP masquerading support for Solaris.

The documentation could always use improvement.

I'd like oidentd to run on more platforms.  I don't have the access to port it
to anything else, however.

Patches for any of the above (and anything else) are welcome.
